[p]cog install didi-cogs [cog]
[p]load [cog]

You may be asked to respond with "I agree" after adding the repo.

## Available Cogs
- Gemini
    - Alternative to the popular Assistant Cog, which can use Gemini's API
    - Commands: `[p]gemini`
    - To obtain an API key, go to https://aistudio.google.com. Google has a free tier. You can extent the limits by quite a bit if you add a billing account, but if you go over the limits it will charge your account. 
- Profiles
    - Very configurable Cog which gives users "profiles" that Admins can edit. Alternatively, you can allow users to set their own profile.
    - Commands: `[p]profile`, `[p]profileset`
Running a command will show all available sub-commands using the help menu.
