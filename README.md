## To install:
`[p]repo add didi https://github.com/DidiDidi129/Didi-Cogs`
Choose which Cog you would like (Look at the folders above), replace (Cog) in the next command with that Cog.
`[p]cog install (Cog)`

The Cogs included are pretty self explanitory, if you need help though you can ping me (@didididi129), in the #other-cogs channel of the (Red - Cog Support)[https://discord.gg/red-cog-support-240154543684321280] server.
