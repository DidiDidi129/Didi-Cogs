The Cogs included are pretty self explanitory just run ?gemini to list all Gemini commands and ?profileset to see the profiles commands, if you need help though you can ping me (@didididi129), in the #other-cogs channel of the (Red - Cog Support)[https://discord.gg/red-cog-support-240154543684321280] server.
